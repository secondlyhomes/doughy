# Local SEO

Local SEO is where small businesses win. Large national sites can't compete on hyper-local searches. Someone searching "[service] near me" or "[service] [city]" wants a local expert.

## Google Business Profile (Priority #1)

**Setup**: https://business.google.com

> **Note**: Google has shifted primary profile management into Google Search and Google Maps directly. The standalone dashboard at business.google.com still works for login, but most editing now happens via Search/Maps. GBP has added AI-powered features including AI-generated Q&A and menu scanning.

### Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Choose the most specific primary category for your business
- [ ] Add 3-5 relevant secondary categories
- [ ] Use all 750 characters in business description with natural keywords
- [ ] Add high-quality photos (exterior, interior, team, products)
- [ ] Set accurate business hours including holidays
- [ ] Enable messaging if you can respond promptly
- [ ] Pre-populate Q&A with common questions (and answer them yourself)
- [ ] Post updates weekly (offers, events, news)

> **Category examples by vertical**: See [examples/](../examples/) for recommended GBP categories by industry.

## NAP Consistency (Critical)

**NAP = Name, Address, Phone**

Your business info must be written **exactly the same way everywhere**:

| Platform | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Website footer | Acme LLC, 123 Main Street, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78701, (512) 555-1234 |
| Google Business | Acme LLC, 123 Main Street, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78701, (512) 555-1234 |
| Yelp | Acme LLC, 123 Main Street, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78701, (512) 555-1234 |
| All others | Acme LLC, 123 Main Street, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78701, (512) 555-1234 |

Even "Street" vs "St." or "(512)" vs "512-" can confuse search engines.

**Create a master NAP document and copy-paste from it everywhere.**

## Location/Category Landing Pages

Create dedicated pages for each location or category you serve.

### URL Structure

```
/services/[city-state]/
/[service-type]/[city-state]/
/locations/[city]/
```

### Content Requirements

Each page should have **unique content** (not templates):

- [ ] Location-specific description (500+ words)
- [ ] Local landmarks, neighborhoods, or points of interest
- [ ] Service-specific details for that area
- [ ] Local testimonials if available
- [ ] Nearby areas served
- [ ] Local contact info or office hours
- [ ] Embedded Google Map

### Example Hierarchy

**Tier 1 (Launch)**
- Primary service area (3-5 pages)
- Highest population/revenue areas

**Tier 2 (Month 2-3)**
- Secondary service areas (5-10 pages)
- Expanding coverage

**Tier 3 (Ongoing)**
- Additional neighborhoods/suburbs
- Long-tail local keywords

## Reviews Strategy

### Targets

- 2-4 new Google reviews per month
- Maintain 4.0+ average rating
- Respond to every review (positive and negative)

### How to Ask

1. **In-person**: "If you were happy with our service, a Google review would really help us out"
2. **Email follow-up**: Send a direct link to your Google review page
3. **QR code**: Display in physical location

### Direct Review Link

```
https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=[YOUR-PLACE-ID]
```

Find your Place ID in Google Business Profile settings.
