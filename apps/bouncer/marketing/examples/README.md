## What's in Each Vertical

Each folder contains:

- **schema-examples.json** - Copy-paste schema templates with placeholders

## How to Use

1. Choose your vertical
2. Copy the schema templates from `schema-examples.json`
3. Replace `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with your actual values
4. Implement using the code examples in README.md
5. Claim directory listings in priority order

## Customizing for Your Business

If your business doesn't fit neatly into one vertical:

1. Start with the closest match
2. Combine elements from multiple verticals
3. Use the generic schemas from [STRUCTURED-DATA.md](../seo/STRUCTURED-DATA.md)

## Contributing New Verticals

To add a new vertical:

1. Create a folder with kebab-case name
2. Add README.md with implementation guide
3. Add directories.md with industry directories
4. Add schema-examples.json with templates
